  ABSTRACT = {Distribution Entropy (DistEn) has been introduced as an
              alternative to Sample Entropy (SampEn) to assess the heart rate
              variability (HRV) on much shorter series without the arbitrary
              definition of distance thresholds. However, DistEn, considered a
              measure of cardiovascular complexity, differs substantially from
              SampEn or Fuzzy Entropy (FuzzyEn), both measures of HRV randomness.
              This work aims to compare DistEn, SampEn, and FuzzyEn analyzing
              postural changes (expected to modify the HRV randomness through a
              sympatho/vagal shift without affecting the cardiovascular
              complexity) and low-level spinal cord injuries (SCI, whose impaired
              integrative regulation may alter the system complexity without
              affecting the HRV spectrum). We recorded RR intervals in
              able-bodied (AB) and SCI participants in supine and sitting
              postures, evaluating DistEn, SampEn, and FuzzyEn over 512 beats.
              The significance of “case” (AB vs. SCI) and “posture” (supine vs.
              sitting) was assessed by longitudinal analysis. Multiscale DistEn
              (mDE), SampEn (mSE), and FuzzyEn (mFE) compared postures and cases
              at each scale between 2 and 20 beats. Unlike SampEn and FuzzyEn,
              DistEn is affected by the spinal lesion but not by the postural
              sympatho/vagal shift. The multiscale approach shows differences
              between AB and SCI sitting participants at the largest mFE scales
              and between postures in AB participants at the shortest mSE scales.
              Thus, our results support the hypothesis that DistEn measures
              cardiovascular complexity while SampEn/FuzzyEn measure HRV
              randomness, highlighting that together these methods integrate the
              information each of them provides.},

  journal = {Physiological Measurement},
  abstract = {Objective. The present study investigated how breathing stimuli
              affect both non-linear and linear metrics of the autonomic nervous
              system (ANS). Approach. The analysed dataset consisted of 70 young,
              healthy volunteers, in whom arterial blood pressure (ABP) was
              measured noninvasively during 5 min sessions of controlled
              breathing at three different frequencies: 6, 10 and 15 breaths
              min−1. CO2 concentration and respiratory rate were continuously
              monitored throughout the controlled breathing sessions. The ANS was
              characterized using non-linear methods, including phase-rectified
              signal averaging (PRSA) for estimating heart acceleration and
              deceleration capacity (AC, DC), multiscale entropy, approximate
              entropy, sample entropy, and fuzzy entropy, as well as time and
              frequency-domain measures (low frequency, LF; high-frequency, HF;
              total power, TP) of heart rate variability (HRV). Main results.
              Higher breathing rates resulted in a significant decrease in
              end-tidal CO2 concentration (p &lt; 0.001), accompanied by
              increases in both ABP (p &lt; 0.001) and heart rate (HR, p &lt;
              0.001). A strong, linear decline in AC and DC (p &lt; 0.001 for
              both) was observed with increasing breathing rate. All entropy
              metrics increased with breathing frequency (p &lt; 0.001). In the
              time-domain, HRV metrics significantly decreased with breathing
              frequency (p &lt; 0.01 for all). In the frequency-domain, HRV LF
              and HRV HF decreased (p = 0.038 and p = 0.040, respectively),
              although these changes were modest. There was no significant change
              in HRV TP with breathing frequencies. Significance. Alterations in
              CO2 levels, a potent chemoreceptor trigger, and changes in HR most
              likely modulate ANS metrics. Non-linear PRSA and entropy appear to
              be more sensitive to breathing stimuli compared to
              frequency-dependent HRV metrics. Further research involving a
              larger cohort of healthy subjects is needed to validate our
              observations.},
