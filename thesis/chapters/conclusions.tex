\chapter{Conclusions}
By comparing synthetic benchmarks with physiological measurements, this study highlights that while TE/CJTE via DVP is a powerful tool for detecting directionality and nonlinearity, the interpretation of "conditional" flow must be handled with caution when strong common drivers are present. 
Future work should investigate bias-correction techniques or higher-order partitioning to further refine the independence of the CJTE metric.

Additionally longer measurements on larger cohort of subjects would be beneficial to provide data that would generize the results better.
Morover studing non healthy patients, or varting age groups could provide additional insights into the proposed BRS estimation technique.
